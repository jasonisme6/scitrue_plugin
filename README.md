# SciTrue – Chrome Extension

SciTrue lets you evaluate scientific claims directly on any webpage.  
You can select text and click **Evaluate**, or double-click an empty area to enter your own claim.  
Results appear in a modal window with a clear summary and evidence. If something goes wrong, you’ll see an error card with details.  

## Features

- **One-click Evaluate** – Select text on a normal webpage. A floating “Evaluate” button appears. Click it to run the analysis.
- **Custom Claim Input** – Double-click an empty area to open a single-line input box. Type your claim and click “Evaluate.”
- **Result Display** – Modal window shows:
  - Claim, number of articles, summary, and overall reason
  - List of evidence/subclaims with source, year, relevant sentence, reason, and link
- **Enable/Disable Switch** – Toggle the extension on/off in the popup. The state is saved locally.
